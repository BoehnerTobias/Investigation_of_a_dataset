# Investigation_of_a_dataset
The FBI gun data as well as the U.S. census was taken as basis. The impact of certain measures on the total guns in the country was investigated.


## The following questions were posed and analyzed

1) Figure out the overall development of total guns in the USA
2) States with the most guns (in total and dependend on the population)
3) States with the least guns (in total and dependend on the population)
4) Main drivers of total guns in a state


## Description of the course of action
I cleaned the gun and census data. After that I combined that datasets based on the state. Then I investigated the most important census data and figured out the impact of certain measures on the total guns in the country.


## Outcomes
First the total guns in the US has been rising since 2004. The population of the state has a high influence of the total number of guns. Nevertheless, some states have been identified which have a higher percentage of guns in proportion to the population as well as high total numbers of guns. These states are Kentucky to a very high extend and Indiana to an extend. 
States with a low number of guns in proportion to the population as well as high total numbers of guns were mainly smaller states like Hawaii and Rode Island.
The population, Housing units and Building permits are good indicators for number of guns in a state. This data could be analyzed further, and regression could be used to forecast the number of guns
Demographical indicators do not affect the number of guns. Exemplary the number of females living in a state has no affect on the number of guns
